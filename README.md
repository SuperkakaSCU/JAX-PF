__JAX-PF__: an efficient GPU-computing simulation for differentiable phase field (PF) simulaiton, built on top of [JAX-FEM](https://github.com/deepmodeling/jax-fem) leveraging [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax). 

## The concept of differentiable PF
We want to emphasize the following four features that differential JAX-PF from other PF software:
- __Ease-of-use__: Leveraging capability of automatic differentiation (AD) in JAX, JAX-PF automatically generates Jacobians and derivatives of different energy terms with machine precision, enabling the realization of multi-physics and multi-variable PF models.
- __Automatic Sensitivity__: Implicit time integration with customized adjoint-based AD enables efficient gradient-based optimization and inverse design of strongly nonlinear PF systems.
- __High-performance GPU-acceleration__: Through the XLA backend and vectorized operations, JAX-PF delivers competitive GPU performance, drastically reducing computational time relative to CPU-based solvers.
- __Unified multiscale ecosystem with JAX-CPFEM__: Built on the same JAX-FEM foundation, JAX-PF integrates seamlessly with [JAX-CPFEM](https://github.com/SuperkakaSCU/JAX-CPFEM) to enable coupled process–structure–property simulations (e.g., dynamic recrystallization), while preserving full differentiability for optimization and design.

## Applications
### Benchmarks
Four benchmark problems are provided, including [Allen–Cahn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen%E2%80%93Cahn_equation), [Cahn–Hilliard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cahn%E2%80%93Hilliard_equation), coupled Allen–Cahn and Cahn–Hilliard, each implemented with both explicit and implicit time integration, and [Eshelby inclusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eshelby%27s_inclusion) for lattice misfit in solid-state phase transformations.

:mega: JAX-PF reproduces the benchmark results with good agreement to [PRISMS-PF](https://github.com/prisms-center/phaseField).

## Installation
JAX-PF supports Linux and macOS, which depend on JAX-FEM.
### Install JAX-FEM
JAX-FEM is a collection of several numerical tools, including the Finite Element Method (FEM). See JAX-FEM installation [instructions](https://github.com/deepmodeling/jax-fem?tab=readme-ov-file). Depending on your hardware, you may install the CPU or GPU version of JAX. Both will work, while the GPU version usually gives better performance.

### Install Neper
[Neper](https://neper.info/) is a free/open-source software package for polycrystal generation and meshing. It can be used to generate polycrystals with a wide variety of morphological properties. A good [instruction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wy9n756wFu4&list=PLct8iNZXls-BMU7aleWoSoxgD8OFFe48W&index=5) video is on Youtube.




### Install JAX-PF
Place the downloaded `phaseField/` file in the `applications/` folder of JAX-FEM, and then you can run it.

### Quick Tests
For example, you can download `phaseField/allenCahn/explicit_fem` folder and place it in the `applications/` folder of JAX-FEM, run
```bash
python -m applications.phaseField.allenCahn.explicit_fem.explicit_AC
```
from the root directory. Use [Paraview](https://www.paraview.org/) for visualization.
